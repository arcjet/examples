# Arcjet NestJS example app

[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) helps developers protect their apps in just a few
lines of code. Bot detection. Rate limiting. Email validation. Attack
protection. Data redaction. A developer-first approach to security.

This is an example NestJS application demonstrating the use of multiple
features.

## Features

- Bot protection shows how a page can be protected from automated clients.
- Rate limiting shows the use of different rate limit configurations depending
  on the authenticated user. A logged-in user can make more requests than an
  anonymous user.
- Signup form protection uses Arcjet's server-side email verification configured
  to block disposable providers and ensure that the domain has a valid MX
  record. It also includes rate limiting and bot protection to prevent automated
  abuse.
- Sensitive info protects against clients sending you sensitive information such
  as PII that you do not wish to handle.
- Attack protection demonstrates Arcjet Shield, which detects suspicious
  behavior such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

## Run locally

1. [Register for a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com).

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

3. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your Arcjet key.

4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run start
```

## Try it out

NestJS is a server-side framework, so you won't see much in the browser. Here
are some API routes to try:

### Bot protection

The `/bots` route uses a guard to protect the controller. All automated clients
will receive a 403 response. `curl` is considered an automated client by
default, so you can test it with:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/bots
```

The `/bots-advanced` route returns a more customized response:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/bots-advanced
```

### Rate limiting

The `/rate-limit` route uses a fixed window rate limit. Send 3 requests in quick
succession to see the rate limit in action:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/rate-limiting
```

The `/rate-limit-advanced` route uses a token bucket rate limit with a
customized response. Send 3 requests in quick succession to see it working:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/rate-limiting-advanced
```

### Signup form protection

The `/signup` route uses Arcjet's signup form protection which combines bot
protection, rate limiting, and email verification. To test it, send a POST
request with different email addresses to test:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/signup \
  -X POST \
  --data "email=invalid.@arcjet"
```

Try these emails to see how it works:

- `invalid.@arcjet` – is an invalid email address.
- `test@0zc7eznv3rsiswlohu.tk` – is from a disposable email provider.
- `nonexistent@arcjet.ai` – is a valid email address & domain, but has no MX
  records.

### Sensitive info

The `/sensitive-info` route uses a guard to protect the controller. It will
block requests containing credit card numbers:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/sensitive-info \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -X POST \
  --data "Hello my credit card is 4111111111111111"
```

The `/sensitive-info-advanced` route returns a more customized response:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/sensitive-info-advanced \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -X POST \
  --data "Hello my credit card is 4111111111111111"
```

### Attack protection

The `/attack` route uses Arcjet Shield to detect and block attacks, such as SQL
injection and cross-site scripting. To simulate an attack, send a request with
the special header:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/attack \
  -H "x-arcjet-suspicious: true"
```

After the 5th request, your IP will be blocked for 15 minutes. Suspicious
requests must meet a threshold before they are blocked to avoid false positives.

Shield is configured as a default rule in the `app.module.ts` file because you
typically want to apply it to every route.
