# Arcjet Nuxt example app

[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) helps developers protect their apps in just a few
lines of code. Bot detection. Rate limiting. Email validation. Attack
protection. Data redaction. A developer-first approach to security.

This is an example Nuxt application demonstrating the use of multiple
features.

## Features

- [Signup form protection](https://example.arcjet.com/signup) uses Arcjet's
  server-side email verification configured to block disposable providers and
  ensure that the domain has a valid MX record. It also includes rate limiting
  and bot protection to prevent automated abuse.
- [Bot protection](https://example.arcjet.com/bots) shows how a page can be
  protected from automated clients.
- [Rate limiting](https://example.arcjet.com/rate-limiting) shows the use of
  different rate limit configurations depending on the authenticated user. A
  logged-in user can make more requests than an anonymous user.
- [Attack protection](https://example.arcjet.com/attack) demonstrates Arcjet
  Shield, which detects suspicious behavior, such as SQL injection and
  cross-site scripting attacks.
- [Sensitive info](https://example.arcjet.com/sensitive-info) protects against
  clients sending you sensitive information such as PII that you do not wish to
  handle.
