# Arcjet example: Next.js form

[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) helps developers protect their apps in just a few
lines of code. Bot detection. Rate limiting. Email validation. Attack
protection. Data redaction. A developer-first approach to security.

This is an example Next.js application demonstrating how to protect a Next.js
form which uses an API route. It also uses [Arcjet
Nosecone](https://docs.arcjet.com/nosecone/quick-start) to configure security
headers in middleware.

## Features

- [Bot protection](https://docs.arcjet.com/bot-protection/quick-start) shows how
  the form can be protected from automated clients.
- [Rate limiting](https://docs.arcjet.com/rate-limiting/quick-start) shows a
  rate limit configuration that limits the number of requests from a single IP.
- [Attack protection](https://docs.arcjet.com/shield/quick-start) demonstrates
  Arcjet Shield, which detects suspicious behavior, such as SQL injection and
  cross-site scripting attacks.
