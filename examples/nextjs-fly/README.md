# Arcjet + Fly.io example app

[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) helps developers protect their apps in just a few
lines of code. Bot detection. Rate limiting. Email validation. Attack
protection. Data redaction. A developer-first approach to security.

This is an example Next.js application demonstrating the use of multiple
features.

## Features

- [Signup form protection](https://example.arcjet.com/signup) uses Arcjet's
  server-side email verification configured to block disposable providers and
  ensure that the domain has a valid MX record. It also includes rate limiting
  and bot protection to prevent automated abuse.
- [Bot protection](https://example.arcjet.com/bots) shows how a page can be
  protected from automated clients.
- [Rate limiting](https://example.arcjet.com/rate-limiting) shows the use of
  different rate limit configurations depending on the authenticated user. A
  logged-in user can make more requests than an anonymous user.
- [Attack protection](https://example.arcjet.com/attack) demonstrates Arcjet
  Shield, which detects suspicious behavior, such as SQL injection and
  cross-site scripting attacks.
- [Sensitive info](https://example.arcjet.com/sensitive-info) protects against
  clients sending you sensitive information such as PII that you do not wish to
  handle.

## Â Deploy to Fly.io

1. Set up a new Fly.io app

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy
```

This command will generate a `Dockerfile` and a `fly.toml` for you.

1. Create an Arcjet account and link it to your Fly.io app:

```bash
fly ext arcjet create
```

3. Deploy to Fly.io:

```bash
fly deploy
```

4. Open your app in your browser and try out the features.

5. Review the request details in your Arcjet dashboard:

```bash
fly ext arcjet dashboard
```

## Run locally

1. Log into your Arcjet dashboard to get the `ARCJET_KEY` for your app.

```bash
fly ext arcjet dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

3. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and add your Arcjet key. If you
   want to test the rate limiting authentication, you will also need to add an
   Auth.js secret and [create a GitHub OAuth
   app](https://authjs.dev/guides/configuring-github).

4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
