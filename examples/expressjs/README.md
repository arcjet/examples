# Arcjet example: Express.js

[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) helps developers protect their apps in just a few
lines of code. Bot detection. Rate limiting. Email validation. Attack
protection. Data redaction. A developer-first approach to security.

This is an example Express.js application demonstrating how to protect a website
from abuse.

  rate limit configuration that limits the number of requests from a single IP.
